      "overview": "John Joseph McCann has been a habitual criminal since childhood, when he pilfered cash boxes for his dad. He's been in and out of prison ever since. He lives in a high rise council flat with his mother and sister. It is set in and around the North Sighthill housing estate. Looking After JoJo traces the career of a petty thief turned drug dealer in 1980's Edinburgh. The title character is a pleasant if misguided young man surviving in a bleak housing estate and aspiring to the trappings of a successful criminal. Unfortunately for him, and for most of the other characters in the mini-series, it is a time of heroin addiction and AIDS. We watch JoJo become ensnared in the drugs scene and his deterioration is both painful to watch and very moving. Robert Carlyle's performance is extraordinarily complex and textured. He is ably supported by Jenny McCrindle, Ewan Stewart and Trainspotting's Kevin McKidd. This isn't the fast-moving MTV drug scene of Trainspotting but a more character-oriented, leisurely look at the human cost of drug addiction.",

It began its life as Jô Soares Onze e Meia in 1988 on SBT. Following Jô Soares' return to Globo in 2000, the show was renamed as Programa do Jô, retaining the same format and late-night time slot.\n\nThe show usually features interviews with 3 guests and a live musical performance. Usually, if one of the guests is a musician or band, they return to perform at the end of the show. There are also occasions when the first guest stays on to continue the interview past the first commercial break, in which case the show only features 2 interviews. In most cases, the interviews are longer and more in-depth than those on Letterman's show.",
